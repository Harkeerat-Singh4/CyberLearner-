🚀 Welcome to CyberLearner
CyberLearner is an interactive platform crafted for students, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and tech learners to master encryption and decryption techniques. Experiment with a wide variety of algorithms, visualize how encryption works, and practice secure messaging — all in one place!


✨ Key Features
Multiple Encryption Algorithms 🔒: Supports classic and modern algorithms like AES, DES, RC4, Playfair, Columnar, Rail Fence, OTP, MD5, SHA-256, ROT13, Base64, Atbash, Morse Code, and more.

Random Key Generation 🎲: Auto-generate appropriate random keys specific to the selected encryption method (e.g., numeric for Caesar, alphabetic for Vigenère, etc.).

Light/Dark Theme Mode 🌓: Easily switch between dark and light themes for better visibility and comfort based on your environment.

Copy Result 📋: Copy your encrypted or decrypted result with a single click and paste it wherever needed.

Detailed Algorithm Info ℹ️: Get instant, beginner-friendly explanations for each selected encryption or hashing method, including its working principle and usage rules.

Action Log 📜: View a detailed history of your encryption and decryption actions to track your activities.


Key Reminder 🧠:

Always remember or save the key used during encryption.

Each generated random key is unique and cannot be regenerated exactly the same.

Without the original key, decryption will fail! So make sure to keep it safe.


Exit Feature 🚪: A simple button to securely exit the application after your session is over.

⚡ Quick Notes
Not all algorithms require a key (e.g., ROT13, Base64, Atbash, etc.).

Some algorithms (like MD5 and SHA-256) are hashing methods and cannot be decrypted.

For the OTP (One-Time Pad) cipher, the key length must exactly match the message length.

Always check key requirements shown in the "Key Entry Guidelines" below the key field.

📚 Learn While You Encrypt!
Each encryption method includes a built-in guide explaining its working so that you don't just use encryption — you understand it. CyberLearner makes learning encryption fun and practical at the same time!
